\begin{abstract}

I want to thank my supervising professor at \gls{item}, Stig Frode Mj√∏lsnes, who has been very helpful throughout the project, providing lots of valuable feedback and healthy discussions on both this subject and everything else we've found interesting this semester. Other people on the staff at ITEM and \gls{iet} have also been very forthcoming in providing me with lots of hardware to play around with, for which I'm very grateful.

My appreciation for Roger Birkeland and Amund Gjersvik, both from IET, also needs to mentioned, as without their work on getting the NUTS project on its feet this project would never have existed.

I'd also like to extend my gratitude to Martin Kirkholt Melhus, who proofread and came with valuable feedback on an early version of this report.
