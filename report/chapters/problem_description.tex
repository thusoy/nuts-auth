A new shared-key HMAC authentication protocol for the uplink from the ground station to the NUTS CubeSat has been proposed [1].

This assignment will continue the development of this authenticated protocol design by focusing on the problem of key management, including generation, distribution, and renewal of cryptographic keys.  A very important part of this problem is how to manage a hard reset of the satellite runtime system and be able to re-establish the cryptographic association in a secure way.

The proposed solution should be supported by an experimental implementation that validates that expected failure modes can be handled. If time allows, the student should consider using
electronic circuitry for key generation which can be randomized by available space radiation.
