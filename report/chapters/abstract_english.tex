This project demonstrates \gls{nap}, a new two-way authenticated communications protocol suitable for open networks, such as open Wi-Fi networks or ham radio links, originally intended for usage in the \gls{nuts} CubeSat project. Due to legal restrictions on ham radio links about encoding data, the protocol is intended for applications which need authentication and source integrity, but not confidentiality.

The protocol is based on pre-shared keys and \glspl{mac}, and establishes sessions with sequence numbers to defeat replay attacks. The protocol contains a feature to re-negotiate long-term keys in case they're compromised.

The protocol is verified through scyther, a utility to verify formal security properties of protocols. Potential risks, implementation details and failure modes are discussed, and a sample implementation can be found at \url{https://github.com/thusoy/nuts-auth}. Example usage of the implementation for both the client and server is provided in this paper.
